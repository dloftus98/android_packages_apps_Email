## About this android email app
This repo is forked from the cyanogenmod gingerbread branch.  There are basically 2 files modified to ignore the local security settings and report back to Exchange ActiveSync that everything is implemented.  You'll still get the warning screen that you need to enable a pin etc but it will go away without forcing you to do it.  Feel free to setup pattern lock or no lock if you so choose!
